**Objective:**
Create a robust program that manages a list of student grades using both first-order and higher-order array methods.

**Usage**

```bash
cd Brave-Nodejs\Array-task
node grades.js
```

### **Task Description:**

1. **Initialize an Array of Grades:**

   - Start with an array of numbers representing student grades (e.g., `[85, 92, 78, 88, 90, 67, 95]`).

2. **Add and Remove Grades:**

   - Use `push` to add a grade to the end of the array.
   - Use `pop` to remove the last grade from the array.
   - Use `unshift` to add a grade to the beginning of the array.
   - Use `shift` to remove the first grade from the array.

3. **Modify the Array:**

   - Use `splice` to insert and remove elements at specific positions.
   - Use `slice` to create a new array containing a portion of the original array.

4. **Combine and Split Arrays:**

   - Use `concat` to merge two arrays of grades.
   - Use `join` to create a string from the array of grades, separated by commas.

5. **Reverse and Sort Grades:**

   - Use `reverse` to reverse the order of grades in the array.
   - Use `sort` to sort the grades in ascending order.

6. **Iterate and Transform Grades:**

   - Use `forEach` to print each grade.
   - Use `map` to create a new array of grades, each increased by 5 points.

7. **Filter and Analyze Grades:**

   - Use `filter` to create an array of passing grades (above 70).
   - Use `reduce` to calculate the total sum of grades.
   - Use `find` to locate the first grade that is exactly 88.
   - Use `findIndex` to find the index of the first grade that is below 70.
   - Use `some` to check if any grade is below 60.
   - Use `every` to check if all grades are above 50.

8. **Check for Existence:**
   - Use `includes` to check if a specific grade exists in the array.
